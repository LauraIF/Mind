        Mindfulness. It’s a pretty <em>straightforward</em> word. It suggests
        that the mind is fully attending to what’s happening, to what you’re
        doing, to the space you’re moving through. That might seem trivial,
        except for the annoying fact that we so often veer from the matter at
        hand. Our mind takes flight, we lose touch with our body, and pretty
        soon we’re engrossed in obsessive thoughts about something that just
        happened or fretting about the future.
        <span>And that makes us anxious.</span>Yet no matter how far we drift
        away, mindfulness is right there to snap us back to where we are and
        what we’re doing and feeling. If you want to know what mindfulness is,
        it’s best to try it for a while. Since it’s hard to nail down in words,
        you will find slight variations in the meaning in books, websites,
        audio, and video.
